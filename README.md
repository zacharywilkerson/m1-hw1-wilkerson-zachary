## About Me
Hey there! My name is `Zachary Wilkerson` and I'm a Master's student in the College of Engineering with a concentration in Machine Learning. I previously received my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University.

Outside of academia, I **teach** high school and college math classes (mostly calculus). I am currently working on producing an online video series, along with worksheets, to explain the topic of sequences and series which is a topic most students struggle with. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing **volleyball** and am part of the indoor and beach team here at UF. I also like to spend time outdoors whenever I find it possible to get away from my computer. 

## Past Coding Experience
All throughout undergrad, I coded in **MATLAB**, with some dabbling in **C++** and **R**. Toward the end of my undergrad program and moving into my Master's, I shifted into coding with **Python**. Over the past year, I have become more interested in web development and design which has led me to start learning **HTML**, **Javascript**, and **CSS**. Last semester, I worked through *Harvard's CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript* course. 

## Career Goals
My career goals can be broken down as follows:
1. Obtain a job in the machine learning field;
2. Develop a portfolio website;
3. Expand my teaching side passion, through a website, to offer online courses and schedulable services.
